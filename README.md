# Facial Recognition For Home Safety

## Introduction: 
(Note: This project was done as the final assessment for my Internet Of Things 2 Course.)

The project's aim is pretty simple! To run in Raspberry and use its camera module to provide cheap and effective Smart Door Lock solution and the current version was created as a proof of this concept which can be ran on an computer/laptop.

## Workings:
The ```requirements.txt``` file is included in this repository; please install all of the required libraries and run the ```Project_IOT2.py``` file.

The given password to unlock the system is "HEllo". But entering "BREAK" instead will trigger the system to behave as if someone unknown has broken through the door.

## Results: 
The system works as intended. For instance, it correctly recognizes the password and triggers the alarm when an unrecognized password is entered. This project has helped me understand the basics of facial recognition and OpenCV and how it can be used in a practical application.
